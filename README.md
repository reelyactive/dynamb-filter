dynamb-filter
=============

A __dynamb-filter__ facilitates the filtering of dynamic ambient (__dynamb__) IoT data data based on a standardised set of parameters.

__dynamb-filter__ is a lightweight [Node.js package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dynamb-filter) that is typically used with a [barnacles](https://github.com/reelyactive/barnacles) instance and the barnacles-x family of modules which relay __dynamb__ data to specific endpoints.  Together these packages are core components of reelyActive's [Pareto Anywhere](https://www.reelyactive.com/pareto/anywhere/) open source IoT middleware.

See also the __dynamb-filter__'s sister modules, [raddec-filter](https://github.com/reelyactive/raddec-filter) and [spatem-filter](https://github.com/reelyactive/spatem-filter).


Hello dynamb-filter!
--------------------

```javascript
const DynambFilter = require('dynamb-filter');

let parameters = {
    acceptedDeviceSignatures: [ 'aabbccddeeff/2', '112233445566/2' ],
    acceptedDeviceIds: [ 'aabbccddeeff', '112233445566' ],
    acceptedDeviceIdTypes: [ 2 ],
    acceptedProperties: [ 'isButtonPressed', 'temperature' ]
}

let filter = new DynambFilter(parameters);

let dynamb = { /* Dynamb properties */ };

let accepted = filter.isPassing(dynamb);

console.log(accepted); // true or false
```

See the [reelyActive Developer's Cheatsheet](https://reelyactive.github.io/diy/cheatsheet/#dynamb) for a detailed description of the __dynamb__ and its properties.


Filter parameters
-----------------

The following parameters are supported:

### acceptedDeviceSignatures

Array of device signatures to accept.  A filtered dynamb must have its device signature (deviceId and deviceIdType) included in the list to pass.  For example, to only allow dynambs from a device with EUI-48 identifier aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff to pass:

```javascript
let acceptedDeviceSignatures = [ 'aabbccddeeff/2' ];
```

### acceptedDeviceIds

Array of deviceIds to accept.  A filtered dynamb must have a deviceId included in the list to pass.  For example, to only allow dynambs from devices with the identifier aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff to pass:

```javascript
let acceptedDeviceIds = [ 'aabbccddeeff' ];
```


### acceptedDeviceIdTypes

Array of deviceIdTypes to accept.  See the [list of identifier types](https://reelyactive.github.io/diy/cheatsheet/#idtype) for details.  A filtered dynamb must have a deviceIdType included in the list to pass.  For example, to only allow dynambs from devices with EUI-48 and random 48-bit identifiers to pass:

```javascript
let acceptedDeviceIdTypes = [ 2, 3 ];
```


Filter logic
------------

The __dynamb-filter__ will iterate sequentially through each included filter parameter, and return `false` if _any_ should fail.  If _all_ included filter parameters are passing, the __dynamb-filter__ will return `true`.
